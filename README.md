# british-css

## What is it?

British CSS (BCSS) is a superior version of CSS which uses British English spellings.

## How do I use it?

British CSS is really simple to setup and use. First, install the backage using npm:
```
npm install british-css
```
Next, make a ``src`` and a ``dist`` folder in your project.
Place all of your ``.bss`` files into the ``src`` folder and when you're ready to compile your ``.bss`` files, run ``npm british-css compile`` and your ``.css`` files will be converted and placed into ``dist``.
